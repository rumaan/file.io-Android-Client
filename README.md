This simple app allows you to upload any file and get a _sharable_ link with a set expiration time.
The file will be **Deleted** after its downloaded or after expiration time (regardless of whether its downloaded or not).
This app is made with the help of [file.io](https://file.io) which is an **_Anonymous_, _Secure_** file sharing platform by [Humbly](http://humbly.com/).
